# Plan M001: WING read-only preflight evidence gate

## Checkpoints

| Checkpoint | Objective | Files | Expected behavior | Boundary | Tests | Evidence | Rollback point | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| M001-CP01 | Establish no-WING baseline | `tools/no_wing_release_check.py`, artifacts under `artifacts/no_wing_release_check/` | Quick check runs without WING contact and denies live authority | No hardware, no OSC writes | `PYTHONPATH=backend python tools/no_wing_release_check.py --quick` | `artifacts/no_wing_release_check/20260618T204503Z_no_wing_release_check`; command passed | revert only state/report updates | completed |
| M001-CP02 | Validate read-only preflight inputs | `tools/wing_readonly_preflight_runner.py`, `Docs/runbooks/WING_READONLY_PREFLIGHT.md` | Input validation can run before backend/WING session | No live mutation | no-WING summary validate-run-inputs fields | same artifact; `validate_run_inputs_only_*_matches_expected: true` | revert state/report updates | completed |
| M001-CP03 | Confirm authority denial surfaces | WING handoff packet/reports | Evidence has `live_authority_granted: false` and `readiness_closure_allowed_by_packet: false` before hardware proof | Report-only | no-WING artifact/verifier surfaces | same artifact; live/readiness authority denied | revert state/report updates | completed |
| M001-CP04 | Prepare real hardware handoff | `Docs/runbooks/WING_READONLY_PREFLIGHT.md`, `ops/autopilot/LAST_REPORT.md` | Operator sees exact next WING steps and blockers | No unattended hardware contact | plan-only plus validate-run-inputs-only | `Docs/reports/AUTOMIXER_AUTOPILOT_M001_CP04_WING_READONLY_HANDOFF_20260618.md`; `ops/autopilot/M001_CP04_wing_readonly_preflight_plan.json`; validate-only status `ready_for_websocket` | revert handoff text | completed |
| M001-CP05 | Milestone review | `Docs/ACTIVE_MILESTONE.md`, matrices, ledger | Acceptance criteria mapped to evidence | No product runtime changes | standard test command or documented existing dirty-worktree blocker | review record | revert M001 state commit | pending |

## Required validation at milestone close

- Required checkpoint commands pass or are recorded as concrete blockers.
- `git diff` shows no unintended product runtime edits from the milestone.
- `ops/autopilot/STATE.json` is valid JSON.
- `ops/autopilot/RUN_LEDGER.jsonl` is valid JSONL.
- STOP, lock, stale-run and recovery behavior remain documented.

## First finite Goal

Complete M001-CP05: review milestone evidence and decide whether M001 is
READY_FOR_NEXT or WAITING_FOR_EXTERNAL_VALIDATION.
